Election Data Visualization Dashboard

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to visualize election data in a clear and insightful way. It highlights key aspects such as total votes, voter turnout, party-wise performance, demographics, and historical trends. Each section of the dashboard focuses on a specific analytical area â€” from overall summaries to in-depth comparisons between parties and candidates. The goal of this project is to make complex election data easy to explore and understand through clean visuals, dynamic filters, and real-time insights.
